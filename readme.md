📌 Task 3 – Data Cleaning, Sediment Analysis, Survey Insights & NLP

This task focuses on preparing the dataset and extracting meaningful insights from both numerical and text-based data. Below is the explanation of each step.


---

✅ 1. Data Cleaning

Data cleaning ensures the dataset is correct, consistent, and ready for analysis.
In this task, the following actions were completed:

Missing Values: Checked for empty or null values and handled them appropriately.

Duplicates: Identified and removed duplicate rows.

Incorrect Data Types: Ensured each column has the correct type (numbers, text, dates).

Text Formatting: Cleaned messy text fields and removed unwanted characters.


After cleaning, the dataset became more accurate and reliable for further processing.

✅ 2. Sediment Analysis (Numerical Analysis)

Sediment analysis helps understand how numerical data is distributed.

The task included:

Descriptive Statistics: Finding average, median, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation.

Distribution Patterns: Understanding how values are spread across the dataset.

Detection of Outliers: Identifying extremely high or low values.


This step gives a clear picture of the dataset’s overall numerical behavior.

✅ 3. Survey Insights (Categorical Analysis)

Survey insights help understand the responses given by people in the survey.

This step included:

Analyzing common responses in each survey question.

Identifying which options were selected the most or least.

Observing patterns or trends in survey preferences.


These insights show how participants think, behave, or react based on the survey.

✅ 4. NLP (Natural Language Processing on Feedback Text)

NLP was used to understand written feedback or comments in the dataset.

This included:

Cleaning the text (removing symbols, converting to lowercase).

Understanding word frequency (which words appear most often).

Creating a word cloud to visualize frequently used words.

Sentiment Analysis to check if the feedback is:

Positive

Negative

Neutral
This helps understand the emotions and opinions reflected in the text responses.

🎯 Overall Outcome

By completing Task 3, the dataset is now:

Clean and ready for analysis

Statistically summarized

Survey responses interpreted

Text feedback understood with sentiment

Insights clear and usable for reporting or visualization
